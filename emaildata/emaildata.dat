subject : meter 98 - 7266 ; may 2001 texas general land fuel volume
mike ,
as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .

Subject: 20 th july , 2002
to : the president
from : ab sanni
assalam aleikum ,
i wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality .
i am a . b . sanni , a close confidant to mohammed abacha , son of late
general sani abacha , former head of state federal republic of nigeria , who
ruled from november 17 th 1993 to june 8 th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office .
since then , the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments , by security operatives / agents of the new head of state
( general obasanjo ) who served a jail term under my friend ' s father for
coup offence . even my friend ' s old mother has been detained and tortured
many times . mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father ' s regime e . g . the murder cases of political opponents . these
offences he knows nothing about , as he was only the head of state ' s son ,
not even a military man nor was he in the government .
his father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of crude oil sales as
the head of state . now , the family has lost all assets ( property and money
in nigeria ) to the new government . ref . news watch magazine publication of
11 th to 18 th october , 1999 . however , they have hidden records in a secret
name with the nigerian insurance deposit corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in europe valued at three hundred and thirty eight million
united states dollars only ( $ 338 , 000 , 000 ) . mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that i can not disclose now .
the aim of this letter is to request your assistance to secure this
account in a safe / confidential bank and help invest the money for our
mutual benefit . we also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe country because right now nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape .
if you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email " a _ sanni @ email . com " , so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country , thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment . thereafter we will
sign an mou ( memorandum of understanding ) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in europe valued at three hundred and thirty eight million united
states dollars only ( $ 338 , 000 , 000 ) .
we will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you .
please note that in the process of securing the coded trust account you
are likely to incure expenses but it will be paid back once we secure the
deposit . it is 100 % safe for you and you have nothing to worry about .
just forward via email your full name , phone number , fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you .
we look forward to your helping us , but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality .
ma - salam .

Subject: technica | indicators are positive on this company
the oi | and gas advisory
now that oi | and gas has entered a long - term bu | | market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oil and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us " oi | belt "

potential of mi | | ions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oi | and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pleased to announce that the
alberta energy & utility board has issued license no . 0330206 for the
company ' s weil 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project .
the acadia project consists of 15 sections in alberta in an area that
produces natural gas from the viking formation , has oi | potential in the

and has the potentia | for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases .

symbol - eogi
price - . o 26
the value of eogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - mi | | ions , eogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . emerson oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . already
shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overail market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
developers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in
the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple
returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiarly ciose attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this smail company
with a comparably small market vaiue , is sitting on a bonanza of oi |
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but a | | that will change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equally explosive effect on
the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in
the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or decline
siightly , you will still make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the value of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wil | soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wil | be
staggering .
overail , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been realized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are weil estabiished and are going into massive
production . eariy investors wil | secure optimum gains , and any additional news in
this area wil | realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our
targets upward in next week ' s builetin .

Subject: new enrononline functionality
in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below .
stack manager changes
top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected .
please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .
restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as restricted top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the " restricted top of stack " feature .
advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " all " option from the drop down box .
website changes
new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .
the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .
price of limit orders
modify limit orders
customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the " today ' s orders " section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the " set " button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .
expiration time for limit orders
customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .
float the today ' s orders section
you can now float the " limit order " section . in order to do so , right click in the " today ' s orders " section and select the float window option . in order to make the window " stay on top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .
mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .
in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .
changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users .
please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords .
if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 - 853 - 1787 .

Subject: yesterday ' s off - site
just want to pat each of you on the back , and express my appreciation to each
of you for taking time out of your schedules to meet yesterday . the results
of our time exceeded my expectations in that i feel we had quality discussion
and also identified some ideas and solutions to put in place quickly . each
of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and
positive manner . i also realize we have some follow - up to do , and would
like for us to schedule our next time to meet . i don ' t want to establish
these discussions as " quarterly " or " monthly " meetings at this point - i ' m
not sure what frequency would be appropriate . we can discuss it further as a
team . however , i know we at least one more session and i don ' t want much
time to elapse before we reconvene .
yvette : would look at a time when everyone would be availble in march ,
preferably the week of 3 / 6 , 3 / 13 or 3 / 20 . this may be difficult to schedule
as daren will be working around a new baby , and others are working around
vacation time . i anticipate a similar structure to yesterday ' s , but am very
open to other ' s ideas . please let yvette know if you some other idea .
i also want to express my appreciation to yvette for organizing the
afternoon . she did a great job ! ! !
thanks to each of you ! !

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat?  It's true -- as much as 70% of the population in the US are now considered either overweight or obese. The first thing that most people think of is that their extra bellyfat is simply ugly, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal-fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly determined that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess bodyfat, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess bellyfat.</span></p>

Subject: ny event w / pec & keyspan
louise ,
it is my understanding that you have represented discomfort in signing the ny event expenditure approval form . i appreciate that a " holiday event " or spending any amount on customer entertainment seems counter to what we all are staying awake at night contemplating about our future . however , on our trip in ny we received positive feedback from keyspan ( even with the current events disclosed ) on a jv structure and the interest to leverage a midwest to northeast structure . we described that the ny event this year would be only between pec and keyspan and they immediately placed the date on their calendars . since the meeting they have each confirmed ( chuck , ed & mike ) of their attendance .
please remember $ 15 , 000 of this event is already fixed sunk cost and the incremental amount represents roughly $ 19 , 000 . i am continuing to work with dori to decrease the remaining amount .
i would appreciate your consideration of providing the approval . if not , i need to un - invite pec and keyspan asap . dori needs to act immediately to firm the numbers represented with each of the vendors .
thanx ,
laura

stinson ,
?
here are some options considering what you have
said :
?
1 ) ? we can do a full week of class from may 7 to 11 .
?
2 ) ? the second option is to split the course over two weeks .
if you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of training
then we can try this . ? we have done this before and it has
worked fairly well . ? it would be like :
?
week 1 ( 20 hours ) : ? feb 20 - 23 , tue - fri , 12 : 00 to 5 : 00
week 2 ( 20 hours ) : ? april 9 - 12 , mon - thu , 12 : 00 to 5 : 00
?
these are the only two weeks that are available for venkat
to teach before may 7 th date . ?
?
please let me know if these would work . ? i look forward to
hearing from you . ?
?
regards ,
?

Subject: re : ua 4 - meter 1441 for 11 / 97 - falfurrias
howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .
need help , stella

as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .

i propose accelerating steve ' s move to head the research group here . it
makes sense to include this as part of the mid - year prc process by giving him
a tangible reward along with his performance feedback .

subject : re : london research group
vince - i agree with your conclusion here . we are still trying to fill
dale ' s structuring role as well so part of the question is
how we announce steve ' s lead research role relative to when we know who will
take dale ' s spot . perhaps we should just
move forward with the steve announcement the day that dale moves full time to
ebs . i will ask richard lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes
to the organization .
but i do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have steve here . he is a
wonderfull asset to our efforts .
thanks !

subject : london research group
john ,
i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group .
as you know , dale surbey , who was managing the london unit of the research
group ,
is moving to ebs . dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of
talent we have currently
in london .
given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston , it ' s time
to nominate one member of the research group for a management position .
my recommendation is steve leppard . steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader ,
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers . steve has a very high energy
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent .
his promotion is likely to cause anjam ' s departure form enron . i value
technical
skills of anjam , but in spite of my loyalty to him , don ' t think he is the
same caliber
as steve . however , i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to
houston
for 2 years . i think that the opportunity to work in houston , would be a
sufficient
incentive to keep him in enron . by the way , his performance feedback has
greatly improved .
please , let me know what you think .

from : mr . desmond stevens
urgent assistance .
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . i am mr . desmond stevens , the first son of dr . dennis stevens , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam , the netherlands and decided to write you .
before the death of my father , he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) in a security company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . infact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my father  s money to
a foreign account . since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction .
as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam , the netherlands so that you can open the non - resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . this money i intend to use for investment . i have
options to offer you , first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever option you choose , feel free to notify me . i have mapped out 5 % of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction . if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 25 % of the money while the remaining 70 % that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country .
please , contact me with the above telephone and e - mail address , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction .
yours faithfully ,
desmond stevens .

Heather thought it would be perfect to use grocery funds to find out how to 'hack' her weightloss. According to Heather, "the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked.

tenaska iv has been operating without a " gas agency agreement " since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken
through the bank consent process ?

short account resemblance difference between drt dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aim account linguistic informational balance between static dynamic information , propose abstract

between event . difference between simple past perfect aspectual , obvious examine light difference between event state : simple past describe event context-dependent while perfect stative information . aspect impose control flow information here ter meulen introduce three main universal aspectual class , hole , filter plug closely relate , respectively , vendler 's classical ontological class activity ( " john run half hour " ) , accomplishment ( " john build house " ) achievement ( " john win race " ) . ter meulen introduce notion situate reason : accord , temporal vantage point text reason text proceed . first ( descriptive ) factor . second ( aspectual ) factor source information , while third factor perspective information . temporal information process against context ( ) incorporate least lexicon syntax language , situate logical inference rule , semantic constraint ( presupposition ) , available information element situation . 2 . aspectual verb aspectual verb

) monotonicity . cube visualize dynamic transition begin + start ; stop " end " " finish " . bottom correspond stative hole , while top correspond dynamic plug , allow four combination arrow english : dynamic plug + increase monotonicity , dynamic plug + decrease monotonicity , stative hole + increase monotonicity , stative hole + descrease monotonicity . external negation flip leave arrow change dynamicity , while internal negation flip right arrow . finally , arrow kinematic , whereby combination arrow above dynamic stative aspect , alway determine right arrow ( . e . value combination alway value right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect tree ( dats ) dats graphically represent information event direct graph where node , label descriptive information , either hole plug . each dat unique source node ( plug ) , rightmost terminal node , correspond utterance event determine perspective . information past tense precede source represent node branch leave . present information include source . thus left-to - right order represent flow while downward arrow represent temporal inclusion . dats temporal reason past ( though allow modality counterfactual ) .

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bul | market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us " oi | belt "
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oil and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pieased to announce that the
alberta energy & utility board has issued license no . o 3302 o 6 for the
company ' s we | | 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project .
the acadia project consists of 15 sections in aiberta in an area that
produces natura | gas from the viking formation , has oi | potential in the
bakken zone and gas potentia | in the coiony and second white specks
zones . the viking contains natura | gas in we | | s around the acadia project
and has the potentia | for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases .
gas welis in the area have calcuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day .
the project is | ocated in eastern aiberta with year round access and an

the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wiil skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - mi | | ions , eogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . already
shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
developers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in
the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple
returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this sma | | company
with a comparably smail market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but all that wiil change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive effect on
the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? we | | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or decline
siightiy , you wi | | stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wi | | soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors will be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
production . early investors wil | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this area wil | really turn up the heat , causing us to revise our
targets upward in next week ' s bulletin .

(TMZ)  Here's what Gwen Stefani told Ellen about Blake (Sheldon)'s dramatic body transformation.
"Blake is a busy guy, I mean he barely has enough time for me, so to shed 31 or so lbs in a month... I couldn't believe it!"
Gwen went on to explain what Blake was and is using to achieve his body makeover. "I did ask him about it because he got so thin so fast I was concerned he was doing something illegal. He showed me what he was taking and I was surprised. He doesn't even workout and he keeps getting in better shape."
Blake Shelton isn't the only one who is seeing the positive effects of this new slim down secret. Hollywood celebrity Khloe Kardashian shocked the world after dropping 27 lbs in just3 weeks with the new supplement. "I Couldn't believe how quickly I saw the effects.. and the fact that I could eat whatever I want when I want and still lose!" said Khloe as we spoke with her after the VMA's. Other celebrities like Melissa McCarthy and John Goodwin have used it and had incredible success.
According to a new study from researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center, men and women who took the supplement for 8 weeks lost an average of 16.9 LBS, without special meals or exercise. Another study published in Nutrition Research found that people taking the extract dropped an average of 6.0 percent of their bodyweight, including 12.2 percent of their bodyfat - with zero side effects.

Great atmosphere!!! Amazing food and amazing service!!! This place is a hidden gem!!! I will be back for sure!! Great food!....Bartender was a USMC vet that was attentive but not overbearing. Drinks were filled without asking because tea is obviously free.....Asked about... I love the clubhouse!! Their food is awesome and the prices aren't bad!! They are the only place in town that has the seasoned french fries that are so... I've always had wonderful service and great food every time I've been here. The best thing is the ice cream.

to be honest , i really do not think my sign off on this .
it looks like the money is already mostly spent on the new design ( i like it if that helps ) - if you get delayed there obviously will be timing issues . the added functionality is definitely something beneficial which we want whichever the outcome is .

i would like to move forward with what we are calling phase iii for eol . most of the work is done but in this environment , i don ' t want to prepare to roll it out in january without your views . however , if we are to roll it out in mid - january , we need to agree soon .
richter has sent you the outline / presentation on e - mail and he and savita and jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like .
savita discussed the presentation and the plan with john arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality .
basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page , but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static reuters content down the side ( which will be put in a mycontent button ) . this isn ' t expensive , most of the work is done anyway , but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded .
i think it would be positive to do . it looks better , the reuters content can be found in a mycontent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience . it also shows business as usual with enrononline .
your thoughts ?

i am mr . ike ejoh . bank manager of diamond bank of nigeria , lagos branch . i have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you . on june 6 1999 a foreign oil consultant / contractor with the federal ministry of aviationmr . barry kelly made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( twenty - five million dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers , the federal ministry of aviation that mr . barry kelly died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . barry kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one willever come forward to claim it . according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 6 ( six ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . consequently , i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called global & basic financial company . , i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits , which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company . i shall employ the service of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the bran

less than two hours later , two veiled women - - reportedly the man ' s sister and fiancee - - attacked a tour bus . egyptian police officials and the government - guided al - ahram newspaper said the bus was carrying israeli tourists . after firing on the tour bus , negat yassin then shot and wounded her companion before killing herself . khamis died later of her wounds . officials said they acted in revenge for yassin ' s death . it said police earlier in the day captured two suspects - - ashraf saeed youssef and gamal ahmed abdel aal - - in connection with that attack and were chasing a third , ehab yousri yassin , on a highway overpass when he jumped off , setting off the nail - filled bomb . " we only hope that these attacks do not stand in the way of political reform , " he said in a statement , acknowledging that mubarak had no plans to end emergency law " whether these attacks take place or they don ' t . " two militant groups posted web statements claiming responsibility for the twin attacks - - the mujahedeen of egypt and the abdullah azzam brigades . neither claim ' s authenticity could be verified . women are not known to have carried out past attacks in egypt . fouad allam , a retired general in egypt ' s anti - terrorism security apparatus , said there is no way to compare the recent attacks with those in the 1990 s , which were led by larger , more organized groups that have since been marginalized by a protracted , harsh government crackdown .

aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron

homeland security investments
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2 ool have
changed
the security | andscape for the foreseeabie future . both physica | and
| ogica |
security have become paramount for all industry segments , especia | | y in
the
banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,
a
wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for
information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by
2005 .
homeland security investments is a newsietter dedicated to providing
our
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this
lucrative sector . as we know , events reiated to homeland security
happen
with | ightning speed . what we as investors can do is position
ourseives in
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to
capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security
investments is here to heip our readers do just that .
with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,

* * * why we believe vnbl . ob wiil give big returns on investment * * *
* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wireiessly .
* vnbl is aiready an industry pioneer in the rfid persona | location
technology .
* vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which aliows companies
and
governments to wireiessly track their assets and resources . such
technology
has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materiais
designated " high risk " were they to fall into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create " high security space " in locales where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuclear faciiities , and more .
* as with ail stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has
made vnbl a hot buy .
news on vnbl
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it pians to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
contro | of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemical industries .
aithough smail wireiessiy networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible probiems before they become serious , they
can
also deiiver safety features within oi | weils . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a wel | filling with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handier , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personne | safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a faciiity , rfid tags would
enabie the customer to track and evaiuate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this appiication technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
aiso assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previousiy stated is that these appiications are
more
than just a vaiuable too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natura | resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technoiogy
appiication
in the oi | & gas and petrochemica | industry wil | further position
vinoble in
a rapidiy expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and globa | spending that the company wiil require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to aiso provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smaliest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personne | and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptiona | . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truiy
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .

Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents
august , 2002
dear sir / madam ,
in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have
been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .
we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than
seventy - five percent
we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .
there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :
statistics advantages
options
economics
we are looking for the followings :
01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )
( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .
( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces
( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide
more than 2 billion us $ per day .
( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )
theadvantages of the technology developed by us :
a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .
b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .
by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .
c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .
as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :
2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .
d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .
e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .
3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .
f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .
g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .
h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .
i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .
. among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options
available to us : -
a - outright sale
( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .
( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in " a " .
the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .
b - licencing options
i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .
ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .
c - combined options
a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .
the economics of the project will be as follows : -
1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .
2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .
but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .
3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .
4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .
5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .
6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .
7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .
8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .
9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .
10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .
11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .
12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .
p . s .
1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .
2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

Subject: entex adjustments for 5 / 00
i have reviewed the entex actuals and adjusted gas control ' s entex factor for
the month of may . i have found that entex estimates have been overstated by
approximately 10 . 0 mmcf / day .
romeo :
will you make sure the estimates that are in pops are corrected to reflect
the new volumes . this should help reduce some of the ua 4 that daren and pat
are trying to locate .
the attached file has the changes that need to be made . please let everyone
on this mailing list know once the changes have been made .

Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
mary ,
hplc currently has a gas purchase agreement ( global # 96014987 ) in place with
calpine that extends through 5 / 31 / 2001 . sitara deal no . 133259 correctly has
this contract attached to it . effective 11 / 1 / 1998 the contract was amended
releasing gouger wells no . 5 & 6 . these wells were apparently the only
producing wells behind this point . evidence being no measured volumes in
mips . there are however other non producing wells behind this point . is
your sept
however , they were not added behind meter 6835 . therefore , i do not agree
that the deal ( 133259 ) should be edited to change the meter .
hopefully this information is useful !

the english language . have you ever wondered why foreigners have trouble with the english language ? . let ' s face it . english is a crazy language . there is no egg in the eggplant
no ham in the hamburger . and neither pine nor apple in the pineapple . english muffins were not invented in england . french fries were not invented in france . we sometimes take english for granted but if we examine its paradoxes we find that quicksand takes you down slowly , boxing rings are square . and a guinea pig is neither from guinea nor is it a pig . if writers write , how come fingers don ' t fing . if the plural of tooth is teeth . shouldn ' t the plural of phone booth be phone beeth , if the teacher taught , why didn ' t the preacher praught . if a vegetarian eats vegetables . what the does a humanitarian eat ? why do people recite at a play , yet play at a recital ? park on driveways and drive on parkways . you have to marvel at the unique lunacy . of a language where a house can burn up as it burns down . and in which you fill in a form by filling it out . and a bell is only heard once it goes ! english was invented by people , not computers , and it reflects the creativity of the human race ( which of course isn ' t a race at all ) that is why when the stars are out they are visible , but when the lights are out they are invisible , and why it is that when i wind up my watch it starts , but when i wind up this observation , it ends .

uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed - out and anticipate their
rebound and upward trend . most of the stocks we track rebound and
peak within just two days , giving investors opportunity to make a few
bucks back in such a highly volatile market . we don ' t believe the
market is such as to take any long - term positions right now . but in
a highly unstable marketplace , the opportunities for short - term stabs
( gains ) are abundant . when the question today seems to be which way
is up , we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way - - - it ' s
all a matter of
timing .

please note that i have re - formatted the attachment to an excel spreadsheet .
try the attachment and let me know if you have any problems . also , in
discussion with duke , txu fuel co . does not have a transportation agreement
with
duke for the redelivery of this gas . the agreement is between enron and duke .
according to brian kerns of duke , they basically took assignment of the
existing
transportation agreement enron had with pg & e ( now el paso ) . if this is the
case , then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards
meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation . any imbalance between enron and duke
on the duke system receipts would be transparent to txu and worked out between
enron and duke . any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual
volumes received at the " teco tap " would need to be worked out between enron
and
txu fuel co . there are a couple of different ways to work this out , but i
need
to review the contract first . please look at this on your side and lets come
to
an agreement as soon as possible since the end of the month is quickly
approaching .
thanks ,

fyi ,
transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating devon ' s
pvr . we do not have access to their contracts to do
the noms . ces use to have transco do it for them and so did we for january
and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we
are , they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you
will have better luck than i did .
thanks ,

there is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2 / 99 . it appears the
variance is created on 2 / 9 / 99 and 2 / 10 / 99 . there is a transport usage deal
ticket 72893 in sitara which shows pg & e delivers 6 , 965 mmbtu to hpl on 2 / 9 / 99
and 3 , 683 mmbtu on 2 / 10 / 99 , but hpl does not show a receipt of this volume .

hello my dear ,
before i introduce myself , i wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and i urge you to treat it serious . i am director of procurement department at the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources , here in the united arab emirates . i obtained your email while searching for a reliable person , who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds . this fund came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the petroleum ministry . this fund has been approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned ministry . the contracts had been executed and commissioned . what i am about to receive now , is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom i helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his estimation for my own interest . this is a normal deal that goes in my ministry by top officials .
on our part , all modalities have been worked out in ensuring a smooth conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days . all i want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf , because as government official i cannot collect the funds directly from the contractor , neither i am allowed by law to operate / run foreign bank accounts . if you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the fund , do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately .
please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in your account for and it will be done through wire transfer . i wish you to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your account . as soon as you indicate your interest , further details and the amount involved shall be given to you once i hear from you . please , treat with utmost confidentiality .
looking forward to hearing from you soonest .

but in front of the tan - yard , close to the entrance , stood a little girl
clothed in rags , very pretty to look at , with curly hair , and eyes so blue
and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them . the child said not a
word , nor did she cry ; but each time the little door was opened she gave a
long , long look into the yard . she had not a button - that she knew right
well , and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside , till all the
others had seen the grave and had gone away ; then she sat down , held her
little brown hands before her eyes , and burst into tears ; this girl alone
had not seen puggie ' s grave . it was a grief as great to her as any grown

kim ,
ect sold 34 , 000 mmbtu to panenergy at meter 4045 for 2 / 99 . i ' ve verified w /
rebekah seales and she has determined that ect did sell this gas to
panenergy . therefore , we need to show a delivery at this meter for panenergy
or whomever panenergy is selling this gas to at this point in pops . i need a
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced .
please take a look at this . call me if you have questions
thanks .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

additional info i see in path manager . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
seems like this is a brokered deal , ect is buying 20 , 000 mmbtu from philips
gas and 14 , 000 mmbtu from superior gas and sell the total 34 , 000 mmbtu to
panenergy .
my question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas , ect or
panenergy ? we need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045 .
please let me know
thanks

the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a long - term bul | market ,
our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us " oi | belt "
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potential of miilions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oil and gas , inc . , ( eogi ) is pieased to announce that the
alberta energy & utility board has issued license no . o 3302 o 6 for the
company ' s we | | 11 - 16 - 24 - 2 the acadia project .
the acadia project consists of 15 sections in aiberta in an area that
produces natura | gas from the viking formation , has oi | potential in the

zones . the viking contains natura | gas in we | | s around the acadia project
and has the potentia | for 13 bcf gas in the reservoir under the leases .
gas welis in the area have calcuiated aof rates up to 14 mmcf per day .

price - . o 26
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wiil skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest buil
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth muiti - mi | | ions , eogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technoiogy to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . already
shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the overa | | market .
in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the
past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized expiorers and
developers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in
the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple
returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervaiued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for | ong . this sma | | company
with a comparably smail market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but all that wiil change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy explosive effect on
the share price .
what wiil the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? we | | we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases in
the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or decline
siightiy , you wi | | stil | make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wi | | soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors will be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
piays in the oi | and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharpiy on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
production . early investors wil | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this area wil | really turn up the heat , causing us to revise our
targets upward in next week ' s bulletin .

Subject: alternative work schedule status
as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was
scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be
provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .
i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we
know are needed in our work hours .
here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :
schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss
at the next meeting .
each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting
bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow
up with hr on schedules being used at enron
the following is what i heard at the first meeting :
our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that
would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have
the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .
cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a " just do it "
attitude .
there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk
changes .
late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders
willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address
this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .
there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some
type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .
feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m
looking forward to our next meeting - bob

Hi Peter,
 
The hotels are the ones that rent out the tent. They are all lined up on the hotel grounds : )) So much for being one with nature, more like being one with a couple dozen tour groups and nature.
I have about 100M of pictures from that trip. I can go through them and get you jpgs of my favorite scenic pictures.
 
Where are you and Jocelyn now? New York? Will you come to Tokyo for Chinese New Year? Perhaps to see the two of you then. I will go to Thailand for winter holiday to see my mom : )
 
Take care,
D
 
Subject: big cowboy - additional production
tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big
cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase
this gas at " hpl meters " at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been
pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes
have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom
and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and
determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im
wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu
tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective
april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .
please let me know if you have any further questions , comments , or
information to add .

roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder approval immediately thereafter .
pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , " this alliance will allow pop 3 to achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . "
roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry today .
" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , " stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .
" additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our artists . "
mr . shebanow concluded , " while there are smaller labels that do provide a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the customer that controversial entertainment will possess .

Subject: cleburne issues
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . .
it was the spring of 1979 .
i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the
cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .
stealing other kids ' lunch money .
no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made
them a little deal . " let me borrow two dollars today , " i said ,
" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . " the investment
was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course
when " next week " rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,
i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit
longer .
eventually the end of the year came and went , high school
started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,
and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more
things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .
i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,
and i didn ' t even get beat up .
hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market
secrets you will ever learn .
first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not
going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when
you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before
grabbing the lifejacket .
second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .
they are looking out for their own money , not yours .
the " professionals " , those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers , will always tell you that the best time to
buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep
your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .
ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
" never " .
in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index
fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :
do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?
hell no !
you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to
make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old
in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in
the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would
you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?
the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .
if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility
is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see
those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t
care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long
it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the
money .
what i ' m talking about here is day trading .
my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks
and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years
he makes money .
the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a
$ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a
certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or
down within hours , sometimes within minutes .
i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing
amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .
society would have you believe that successful trading is
complicated and requires formal training .
the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment
strategies to make money .
popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty
dollars .
they make their money only if you believe two lies :
1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average
person .
2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks
per trade .
here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,
positively do not want you to know . . .
the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying .
after reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade , and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :
* * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .
* * anyone can do it .
* * it only takes a few hours to learn .
when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become
wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .
buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the
only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through
hard work , knowledge , and determination .
after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started
practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks
brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical
experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling
close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no
formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,
i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained
during those formative trading years i am willing to share
with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from
my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,
secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably
year after year .
the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes . the difference between making money and losing your
shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,
and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .
average income of a day trader :
5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year
22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year
35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .
27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year
11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year
after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely
profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you
win despite the current market weakness .
here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :
* * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .
* * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .
* * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to
buy them and the exact price to sell them .
* * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the
mistakes beginners make .
* * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money
consistently in every market !
* * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance
for great success .
* * * profit on huge intraday price swings .
* * * make money on the biggest news stories .
* * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns .
* * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street
professionals use .
* * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .
it ' s time to ask yourself : " am i going to listen to the
professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am
i going to take control of my own financial future , and
start making money right now in the stock market ? "
who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?
with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you
need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of
dollars .
the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to
understand and straight - forward book ever written about active
trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock
trading - order today and start paving the road to your
own financial future .
oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?
his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to
make money in the stock market .
six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california
coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .
in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading
is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking
for a long - term retirement investment with no risk
that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t
your kind of game .
but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune
in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then
order the master trader e - book right now . i promise
to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading .
you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and
anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move .
order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97

deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of january 20 . the
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned
turnaround .
it is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown .
please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer .

Subject: retro assignments
this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to
reiterate retro contract assignments . we have decided to go back to the old
process of handling contract assignments mid - month . this means that if we
receive an assignment from legal after the 10 th workday , that assignment will
become effective for current month the following month . for example , if i
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on 11 / 15 / 00
for an legal effective date of 4 / 00 , i will create a new deal from 4 / 00
forward . on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the
expected volumes . bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12 / 00 ,
leaving 4 / 00 - 11 / 00 to be moved by volume mangement .
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties , please let me know .
rita : if this becomes burdensome on your group , please let me know and we
will readdress this issue .
thanks ! !

Subject: assistance me
my name is mr . newton gwarada , the stepson of mr . terry ford of zimbabwe . it might be a surprise to you where i got your contact address ; i got it from the net . dont be worried because i am contacting you in good faith .
during the current crisis against the farmer of zimbabwe by the supporters of our president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country , he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers .
my stepfather was one of the best farmer in the country and knowing that he did not support the president political ideology , the president supporters invaded my stepfather " s farm and burnt down everything , killed him and confiscated all his investments .
after the death of my stepfather , my mother and i with my younger sister decided to move out of zimbabwe for the safety of our lives . we took along with us the money my stepfather kept in the safe in my mother ' s house which amounted to the sum of us $ 20 m ( twenty million united states dollars ) to the republic of south africa where we have deposited it as personal valuables in a private security company for safe - keeping .
because of our present status ( political refugees ) , my mother and i are sriously looking forward to having an overseas partner that will assist us with the convenient and legal transfer of the funds out of south africa .
if my proposition is considered , for assisting us to transfer this money to your country , we will offer you 20 % of the total fund , and 5 % of the total will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction , 75 % will be for my family to invest . in your country under your supervision .
for detailed information , you can contact me direct .
i would appreciate confidentiality and honesty in our correspondence . your immediate response will be highly wecomed .
best regards ,
mr . newton gwarada

Subject: my october newsletter
hello again ,
my monthly newsletter is attached . please read it and let me
know your comments .
according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .
here is the link to my october newsletter :

subject : re : rate for tenaska deal
sandi ,
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

daren ,
when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ?
based on what index ?
thanks ,

did debbie love jumping in front of the restaurant ? .
toren came to me at age 32 months . he had 2 words : ma ma and bye bye . he could not focus , but ran around the room . his mother was convinced i was going to have him cured by his third birthday . i told her i was no miracle worker , but we ' d do what we could during the next 4 months . immediately we started structuring toren ' s day . i went home and worked up a program called ' toren ' s nouns ' . the first day i showed toren the program , he looked at it for 10 - 15 seconds and then left the computer . the next day he stayed about 30 seconds . each day he built up more time at the computer . by the second week , he would sit on my lap for 10 minutes pressing whichever word he wanted to hear . but he spoke no sounds , no words . three weeks passed . i began berating myself . ' see , jo , you thought this noun program was so great . look at toren , he ' s not learning anything . ' the fourth week toren walked over to the computer , picked up the overlay from the intellikeys keyboard , pointed to 10 different words and approximated each word . that day , i cried . .

may be coming on this weekend ( meter 9696 ) . phone lee in gas control
regarding same . lee informed me that hpl would prefer that the volumes are
not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are
no liquids involved . lee further informed me that the same day to tejas at
hardy was not in the system , and , per gary hanks , needed to be corrected .
lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10 m at hardy / tejas and
10 m at lomax . i went into sitara and updated the deal ticket , pathed and
nominated over to pops .
saturday 1 / 20 / 01 - 8 : 30 am sean paged regarding the nomination at dow
freeport , he was questioning the validity , as we do not often flow at this
meter . i checked and the nomination was good for saturday ' s gas day . sean
informed me that the valero refinery was up and down and would be going
completely down on sunday .
10 : 00 am - sean called regarding tejas laporte , meter 665 . apparently , the
meter had a confirmed volume of 20 m and hpl / ena had no deal at the meter .
checked in pops and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20 m on a deal
volume of zero . informed sean that the tejas volume was confirmed . also ,
per sean koch george west ( meter 6722 ) had a nomination increase of 10 m ,
which he wanted to confirm .
sunday 1 / 21 / 01 10 : 00 am sean paged regarding the dow meter 1442 , pops still
showed a confirmed voume of 10 m which dow and oasis showed at zero for
sunday . i checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at
zero and phoned sean back to confirm . checked on mtp hardy , sean informed me
that we came in on rate for saturday and that current meter activity looked
good .

we have a buyback under hpl ( # 586534 ) . ena had only 7 , 000 / day scheduled at
mtr 1373 in feb . in reviewing the daily volumes in pops , i didn ' t see any
days with flow under 18 , 000 . so , we should not need a buyback for ena . any
shortages should be allocated to the hpl ticket .

grants money - guaranteed ! "
each day over one million dollars in free
government
grants is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of business and personal needs
dear grant seeker ,
in a moment , i ' ll tell you
exactly how where to get grants . this money has to
be given away , why not to you ?
you may be thinking , " how
can i get some of this free grants money "
maybe you think it ' s impossible
to get free money ?
let me tell you it ' s not
impossible ! it ' s a fact , ordinary people and businesses all across the
united states are receiving millions of dollars from these government and
private foundation ' s everyday .
who can apply ?

for a grant from 18 years old and up !
grants from $ 500 . 00 to $ 50 , 000 . 00
are possible ! grants don ' t have to be paid back ,
ever ! claim
your slice of the free american pie .
this money is not a loan ,
trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork , only to find out that you ' ve been denied .
these government agencies don ' t have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do .
you decide how much money
you need , as long as it ' s a lawful amount and meets with the government
agencies criteria , the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid .
this money is non taxable interest free .
none of these programs require
a credit check , collateral , security deposits or co - signers , you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit , it doesn ' t matter , you as
a tax payer and u . s . citizen are entitled to this money .
there are currently over
1 , 400 federal programs , 24 , 000 state programs , 30 , 000 private foundations
and 20 , 000 scholarship programs available .
this year over $ 30 billion
dollars in free personal and business government grants money will be given

anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves , or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world ' s largest " one - stop - money - shop " where free business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the federal
government .
it
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the united
states of america wouldn ' t know that each year the world ' s largest source
of free business help delivers :
over $ 30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low - interest loans ;
over one - half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts ; and
over $ 32 billion dollars in free
consulting and research grants .
with an economy that remains
unpredictable , and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts , the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss !
in
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help , the great government give - away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share , they would each receive over $ 70 , 000 .
most
people never apply for free business grants because they somehow feel it
isn ' t for them , feel there ' s too much red - tape , or simply don ' t know who
to contact . the fact is , however , that people from all walks of life do
receive free grants money and other benefits from the government , and you
should also .

Subject: re : hpl discrepancy
rita , please help me with this . i have some questions regarding enerfin .
why are we re - allocating prior month volumes at enerfin after we matched your
original numbers back in october ? can ' t this be fixed in the actualization
process ?
the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ena had
no transactions with hpl ? can we simply put zero paths in unify and extend
our existing deals in sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize
these small volumes to handle this ? we go round and round at this point
changing volumes two , three or more times . call me if you have questions . .

subject : re : hpl discrepancy
victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

contract 96047295 , meter 098 - 9862 ( 098 - 9848 platform )
bob , we currently have a total of 16 . 817 mmbtu / d nominated for purchases at meter 098 - 9862 as follows :
spinnaker exploration company , l . l . c sit 379424 5 , 886 / d 27 %
ranger oil company sit 533410 5 , 886 / d 27 %
the houston exploration company sit 535119 5 , 045 / d 23 %
it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

subject : unresolved issues for jan 1 . - followup
here is a followup to the memo sent on 12 / 31 / 99 . fyi
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know . unresolved - appears to be unassigned ?
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . unresolved
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . unresolved
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january . resolved but needs to be verified .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated . unresolved or unpathed ?
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? unresolved
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
i haven ' t had time to do this yet . if we haven ' t figured out the assignement
then i will get to it asap .

subject : meter 5961
this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .
thanks

we are going to be rolling out a new product on eol starting this bidweek .
this product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays ( no weekend
delivery ) . currently , the eol / sitara bridge cannot handle this type of
logic , so these deals will have to be input manually .
let me know if you have further questions .

subject : 24 x 5 products
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

Subject: fw : men & cars
because i ' m a man , when i lock my keys in the car i will
fiddle with a wire clothes hanger and ignore your
suggestions that we call a road service until long after
hypothermia has set in .
because i ' m a man , when the car isn ' t running very well ,
i will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if i know what
i ' m looking at . if another man shows up , one of us will say
to the other , " i used to be able to fix these things , but now
with all these computers and everything , i wouldn ' t know
where to start . "
because i ' m a man , when i catch a cold i need someone to
bring me soup and take care of me while i lie in bed and moan .
you never get as sick as i do , so for you this isn ' t an issue .
because i ' m a man , i can be relied upon to purchase basic
groceries at the store , like milk or bread . i cannot be expected
to find exotic items like " cumin " or " tofu " or " cardamom . "
for all i know these are all the same thing .
because i ' m a man , when one of our appliances stops working
i will insist on taking it apart , despite evidence that this will just
cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and
has to put it back together .
because i ' m a man , i must hold the television remote control
in my hand while i watch tv . if the thing has been misplaced ,
i may miss a whole show looking for it ( though one time i was
able to survive by holding a calculator ) .
because i ' m a man , i don ' t think we ' re all that lost , and no , i
don ' t think we should stop and ask someone . why would
you listen to a complete stranger - - i mean , how could he
know where we ' re going ?
because i ' m a man , i do not want to visit your mother ,
or have your mother come visit us , or talk to her when she
calls , or think about her any more than i have to .
whatever you got her for mother ' s day is okay , i don ' t
need to see it . and don ' t forget to pick up something for
my mom , too !
because i ' m a man , you don ' t have to ask me if i liked the
movie . chances are , if you ' re crying at the end of it , i didn ' t .
because i ' m a man , yes , i have to turn up the radio when
bruce springsteen or the doors comes on , and then ,
yes , i have to tell you every single time about how bruce
had his picture on the cover of time and newsweek the
same day , or how jim morrison is buried in paris and
everyone visits his grave . please do not behave as if you
do not find this fascinating .
because i ' m a man , i think what you ' re wearing is fine .
i thought what you were wearing five minutes ago was fine ,
too . either pair of shoes is fine . with the belt or without it
looks fine . your hair is fine . you look fine .
can we just go now ?
because i ' m a man , and this is , after all , the 2000 ' s , i will
share equally in the housework . you just do the laundry ,
the cooking , the gardening , the cleaning , and the dishes . i ' ll
do the rest .

today enron and hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $ 666 trillion .
in the deal , enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to hades '
facilities throughout and under north america . john d . rockefeller , former
ceo of energy monopolist standard oil , is now head of hades ' energy
management division . said rockefeller , " obviously hell has significant
heating demands . while eternal flames are a great idea in concept , they
require vast and reliable fuel resources . enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss , and , as a former monopolist , i just
like the way they do business . "
a spokesperson for enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations . according to the company , " the deal fits both
companies exceptionally well . with hades ' ability to attract and retain new
customers , we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come . " according to several energy industry insiders , hades ' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition .
hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers . the entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years .
enron is one of the world ' s leading energy and communications companies .
the company owns approximately $ 37 billion in energy and communications
assets . enron ranks in the top quarter of fortune ' s " best 100 companies to
work for if you can keep a job there and don ' t mind working 80 hours a
week , " and is among the most respected corporations in america , as ranked by
customers with respect - us - or - get - curtailed clauses in their energy supply

judgment coursesoffers an extensive training
course in " how to collect moneyjudgments "
if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a
money judgment is and why processing money judgments
can earn you very substantial income .
if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a money judgment against them .
you are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the
judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you .
the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser
down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts ,
real estate , stocks and bonds , etc .
very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found . the result is that millions of
judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten .
in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a
dime .
the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions . right now in the united states there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney
judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more
judgments take its place .
we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this
business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed .
with our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing money judgments .
by following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of money judgments .
the income potential is substantial in this profession . we
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per
year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00
and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices .
today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in money judgments that we are currently
processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates .
joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break
even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on
the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies , police
officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us
for reports .
many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars .
legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 %
interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments .
annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to
$ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the
payment of the principal .
our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per
year . this is just for interest , not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income . typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars .
92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 %
are women and 36 % are part time .
one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are
working on will be there when you return . the judgments
are still in force , they do not disappear .
the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you
never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you
are . you are not a collection agency .
simply stated the steps to successful money processing
are as follows :
mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who
to write to )
8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them
unless you want to .
you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and
50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for
$ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 .
you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you . they range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment
locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc .
the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to
1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge
$ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $ 25 . 00 .
once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located .
( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course )
when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to
the original judgment holder .
once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of
judgment to the court . ( included in the course )
quote ' s from several of our students :
thomas in area code 516 writes us : " i just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my
first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your
professionalism in both the manual and your support .
you have the video opened doors for me in the future .
there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states
he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on "
after only having this course for four months , larry s . in
area code 314 stated to us : " i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in
judgments i am collecting on now "
after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated
" i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately
$ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i
will have to hire someone to help out "
marshal in area code 407 states to us " i feel bad , you only
charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months "
> from the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following :
with our course you can own your own successful business .
a business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world . a business which is
extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every
day is new and exciting .
none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is
challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate
downsizing . a business which you can start part time from
your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full
time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you
control your own destiny . our training has made this happen
for many others already . make it happen for you !
if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation
on your part .
please call us at 1 - 281 - 500 - 4018 .
we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to
10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel .
they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation .
sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you
read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person
can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not .
thank you for your time and interest .

duke is calling regarding the volumes we are delivering into channel at the

okay with paying back . this just in from mark mccoy , the oasis oba is flat

effective 3 / 1 / 2001 , hplc amended its contract with royal production changing the price to 100 % hsc less $ 0 . 16 and extending the term through 2 / 28 / 02 . consequently , for march , hplc should be purhasing volumes from two wells at meter 5310 . effective april , hplc amended the same contract releasing the l . g . talbert # 2 lease in the committed reserves agreement ; mike morris is the gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000 mmbtu / d . for april i nom 1132 / d ; bob , we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental production at this point .

Subject: re : txu imbalance
james , thanks for following up on this .
fyi to all , the agreement we have with el paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal ( as well as external ) communication of the transaction :
" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information . "
the language stems from a problem we had when east coast power was sold late last year , but probably works to our advantage in this case . suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what ' s coming down the pipe . however , we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible .
thanks ,

Subject: cum pill also cures impotence
my girlfriend and me have been really enjoying making
our own homemade erotic films . we get off on pretending
to be like porn stars even though it will only ever be
the two of us that see them . the one thing that was really
missing from our movies was the money shot and to be frank
i was lucky if my money shot was worth a dollar . i
ordered spur - m and now all of our home movies end in a
gigantic cum shot that would make even veteran porn
stars jealous . thanks spur - m for helping to spice up
our sex life !
anthony , ky
my wife and i cannot afford the prices for ivf treatment .
after i tried spur - m , i found that my sperm motility was
improving as each month went by . now i have a healthy baby
girl . spur - m helped me so much with improving my own
fertility and i just want to say thanks . this is fantastic
to be able to see a real natural ivf alternative , which is
much cheaper than the prices for ivf ! ! !
m . larsson , michigan , usa
spur - m really works . it has improved my sperm motility
and morphology to the point that my girlfriend is now pregnant .
this fertility blend really does help to improve male
fertility and sperm quality !
adam j . , san francisco , usa
i tried spur - m fertility blend for men for 3 months and
noticed a lot of improvements in my sperm quality . i am
surprised they don ' t make this product more widely available .
it helped my tremendously , and i will be telling people
about its effectiveness .

we have noticed that we are taking earnings on megs this year which is probably the wrong thing to do based on the fact that we know that future income is negative we should be using the income to write down the holding or against future income .
can you reanalyse the bookings this year and ensure we do not book any earnings .

vince ,
how are you ? hope all is well .
is there any chance we can schedule my visit to enron on friday , may 19 ,
or friday , may 26 ?
by the end of april i was able to attract a top new student to work on the
project .
the other one for the coming year will be giuseppe . by spending the summer
at enron , he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and
create an intellectual team here at stanford to look at these problems .
i must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going .
talk to you soon ,
nick

subject : re : tenaska
that sounds great . because of the accrual , i cannot draft this today . i
will try it on monday . what about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska
iv . do you think that is a good idea ? i explained it to kris hanson and she
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable . we would need a new
demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of
$ 2 , 803 , 586 . 41 with no volume and no commodity . this is more than we owe
tenaska iv , but i will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $ 0 . 04 demand
fee to pay a net amount of $ 1 , 551 , 050 . 76 . i have attached my spreadsheet
which details our payment . we will have to adjust this number once we get
the actual volumes . i would like to pay tenaska iv next week , so please let
me what you think .
thanks ,
megan

WHat is going on there?
I talked to John on email.  We talked about some computer stuff that's it.
I went bike riding in the rain, it was not that cold.
We went to the museum in SF yesterday it was $3 to get in and they had
free food.  At the same time was a SF Giants game, when we got done we
had to take the train with all the Giants fans, they are 1/2 drunk.

Subject: aep interest payment vs . coastline lawsuite costs
louise ,
i have developed the attached proposal that i would like to propose to aep . the basis of the proposal is that :
1 . aep would take on all costs , risks , liens , etc . associated with the coastline law suite ( low case $ 1 . 8 mm , expected case $ 2 . 5 mm ) .
2 . enron would forego 1 months of interest due to aep ' s failure to get doj approval ( $ 2 . 1 mm ) .
benefits to enron :
1 . potential savings in enron expense vs . aep ' s ability to capitalize the cost .
2 . enron still retains the " doj stick " in that interest payments start on 1 june instead of 1 may .
3 . enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim .
4 . enron does not have to wrestle with aep to get access to hpl staff who are involved in the suite . ( even though aep is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim , aep will have no incentive to do so after the sale ) .
let me know if you have any objections or questions .

Subject: re : real options presentation
thanks for the comments grant . the presentation is for a couple of external
conferences that vince volunteered me for - vince has ok ' d the content , and
stinson raised exactly the same issues as you . unfortunately i just don ' t
seem to be getting any response from risk whatsoever on the publication of my
article , so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options
notation .
of course the discounting / risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement
sits . when questions arise i ' ll take the line that while research formulates
the models using appropriate derivatives / market based valuation methods , we
work with our rac group which considers the discounting to be associated with
various risks , and chooses these rates appropriately . the notation makes
clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals ,
which assists in choosing the rates .
in practice i ' m not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation
yet - another reason i can ' t say too much about its actual use at the
conference . i ' m producing various tools for deterministic hydro
optimization , gbm swing option valuation , and deterministic dp optimization
for genset dispatch which people want right now - i ' m working in the
background on the kind of modelling my notation demands . people are getting
to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems , and they ' ll be
more likely to listen when i start rolling out the " proper " options - based
models . my notation is currently used only in the specs i ' m writing for the
tools i ' m producing .
i ' ll be turning dale ' s spreadsheet - based power plant spread model into an
american monte carlo tool , which will then be available for inclusion in
other models . i think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical
work will start to bear fruit , one year after i initially proposed the
notation . with the quant it group i ' m co - creating in place , i may yet see
the automated diagramming / pricing tool made real .
thanks also for the pointer to tom halliburton . the use of the lingo
lp / integer package is something i ' ve been presented with for the teesside
plant operation optimizer , rather than something i chose . the perm ( physical
energy risk mgt ) group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together
( including natasha danilochkina ) , then asked me to tidy it up when it didn ' t
work . they are going to use their existing faulty model for now ( to meet
their project deadlines ) , and i ' m sketching out a proper mathematical spec
for the problem .
i ' ve persuaded ( ! ) them that this sort of business - critical system should be
developed properly by research , and they now seem happy to fall into line .
their wilton plant optimizer was developed by one peter morawitz , the guy i
hoped to recruit into research , and they obviously didn ' t realise he was
better than average at quantitative modelling . anyway they now accept that
doing it properly will take months rather than weeks , and i ' ll have a freer
hand in my choice of modelling tool - so a chat with tom would be extremely
valuable .
cheers ,
steve
enron capital is
this an internal enron or external presentation ? if external , i would say it
is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff . perhaps that ' s
why you ' ve neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and
risk - neutrality or lack of it ?
regards ,
grant .

Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 .
i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .

subject : netco items
wanted to share the latest communication on netco . this is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward . i will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below .
for a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the netco team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown . i know you took a preliminary look at this but i want you all to rethink and give me a " final or startup " list . the list you gave me on the contracts required for netco on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed . i believe we need to take a look at some of the intrastates and key ldc ' s and get that info on the list . seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6 . i ' ll try and get some details today . don ' t know if we will be allocated spots on 6 . it systems layout and structure is already being planned / discussed . most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture .
in addition any other items for a re - start that you can think of please forward to me .
of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once / if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase . let ' s be optimistic and hope they are interested in the netco structure that has been laid out . regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready .
thanks - bob
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .

subject : re : physical curve mappings _ sitara
ow ,
i went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves / mapping we can delete ( yellow ) and those we can change ( orange ) . the only curves we will have left are katy , waha , hsc , agua dulce , and thompsonville . i expect to be using thompsonville in 6 months to a year . if it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it , that will be fine . let me know if you have any questions .

subject : physical curve mappings _ sitara
hey gang ,
attached are the physical curve mappings as provided by russ severson . . . please take a peek and let us know if we need to change , add / delete , update any points / mappings going forward in a netco environment . . . for instance , i would like to change texoma to carthage on the curve mappings . . . also , i would like to delete all derived curves , leaving only carthage , katytailgate , and agua dulce .
the other physical locations would be shipchannel , waha and katy ( non - tailgate ) . . . let me know your thoughts . . . o ' neal 3 - 9686

Famous TV doctor worked with a student researcher from Stanford and a mother of 2, Heather Nelson. She was able to shed 38lbs off her waist in 4 weeks without ever spending more than 5-dollars. On a tight budget, Heather used some grocery funds to find natural ingredients to accelerate her slim-down. 
See how Heather was able to drop 36lbs off her waist in 30 days => http://arming.habtix.club/bellymeltingcombo-applegarcinia

     <h2 align="center">Student Researcher Discovers<br> $4 Weightloss Accelerator</h2>

     <p><span style=" font-size:16px;"><b>(by Cynthia Smith, 02Sep2017)</b> - A student researcher from Stanford and a mother of 2, Heather Nelson, was able to drop 37lbs off her waist in 1 month without ever using more than 5 dollars of her own money. Heather thought it would be perfect to use grocery funds to find out how to 'hack' her weightloss. According to Heather, "the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding what worked. But the actual solution only cost about $4."</p>

* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wireiessly .
* vnbl is aiready an industry pioneer in the rfid persona | location
technology .
* vnbl is deveioping a form of rfid technology which aliows companies
and
governments to wirelessiy track their assets and resources . such
technoiogy
has huge potentia | in the protection and transportation of materiais
designated " high risk " were they to fall into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create " high security space " in | ocaies where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuclear faciiities , and more .
* as with a | | stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has

opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it pians to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
contro | of equipment , assets , toois , and the reiated processes used in
the
oi | & gas and petrochemical industries .
aithough smail wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possibie probiems before they become serious , they
can
also deiiver safety features within oi | we | | s . oil maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a wel | filiing with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and | imit the
entry of personne | to specific | ocations . ensuring personne | safety is
essential , shouid there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags wouid
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technoiogy requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vita | to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemica |
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previousiy stated is that these applications are
more
than just a vaiuabie too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natura | resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company beiieves that such offering service and technology
appiication
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and globa | spending that the company wil | require

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of " excess " gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

Wheel of Fortune facing cancellation as Vanna White drops a bombshell. 
Read the Exclusive Story Here: http://behind.vtywu.stream/vanna-white

It has become a hobby of mine to find these little family dinners when I travel. This one didn't disappoint. Great food and value. Love the decor. Some of the best Mexican food I've had! They have different items on their menu that you don't normally see on other Mexican menus. I would highly recommend! This place is a absolute gem, what a location. It looks like a couple houses together with a very unique look inside. We got lucky and made reservations for... Lunch at the Thyme2 Pub...   Outstanding!  Burgers, salads , wood fired pizzas , sandwiches, great apps and desserts. No short cuts taken. Scratch kitchen.... Stopped in for an early dinner. The food was wonderful, gnocchi was a work of art., and the Old Fashioned was right on. Having eaten here several times the food has always been excellent. My sister and I chose to host my niece's bridal shower in their private room.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

<h3 align="center">Will NBC Cancel Wheel of Fortune After 35 Years?</h3>
<!-- Plain Text Content  -->
     <p><span style=" font-size:12pt;"><b>(Us Weekly News)</b> ??? Vanna White has struggled with weight all her life. Two years ago Wheel of Fortune told her to "Shape Up or Get Out". She either needed to drop 15pounds or find a new TV Show. </p>
      <p style="font-size:12pt;">White, who wore a size 10 then, needed a quick, consistent fix to shed pounds to keep her job. After stuggling with her body image issues her entire life she had tried Atkins, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and a slew of other programs without any success, she fell into depression and her marriage almost fell apart. She couldn't risk undergoing surgery and didn't know what to do next. The pressure to get her stunning figure back was unbareable.</p>

here ' s the latest global performance management schedule for ye 2000 and some
friendly reminder tips for you and your direct reports . the system is
scheduled to open for feedback in 35 days . please forward all mid - year 2000
evaluations to janet de la paz at eb 3658 a .
july 31 - oct 13 th development & testing
oct . 2 - 13 th training - hr community
oct 9 - 27 th training - all employees

oct . 23 rd system opens for feedback
nov . 17 th system closes for feedback
nov . 20 th prc meetings begin
dec . 15 th prc meetings conclude
jan 4 - 5 th executive committee meeting
reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .
let me know if you have any questions .

Subject: zero path termination in path manager
matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as " always send nominations " will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the " volume management - do not send " function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .

investors are making huge gains as the world bets online .
could gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?
recently ,
we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and
how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the
next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could
have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all
over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became
obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to
bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .
merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the
potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another
source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this
business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the
single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online
gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be
an ideal time to is time to invest .
we decided to
find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with
a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,
publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a
close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .
although
ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at
the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .
the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .
and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the
keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it
gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream
gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online
gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers
these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the
company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in
the investment community and driving up its stock price .
after a successful north american launch ,
gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese
and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business
decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest
source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .
what
does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,
one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced
management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .

en el diario de la jornada del lunes 27 junio 2005 en la entrevista de victor ruz arrazola ; destacados miembros del comit de vigilancia ciudadana dijeron :
alejandro dacosta ; manifest que en materia de remodelacin y restauracin es sumamente difcil comprobar inversiones ; quiz por ello el instituto del patrimonio cultural del estado de oaxaca no ha informado con detalle cuantos millones de pesos se invertirn en el zcalo , solo ha dicho que son 800 millones de pesos para todo el centro histrico , pero son obras que la ciudadana no considera prioritarias .
cuestion que se invirtieron recursos pblicos en la remodelacin del ex palacio de gobierno , que despus ser destinado a museo ; la ex casa de gobierno se remodela para destinarla a hotel escuela ; al ex recinto legislativo tambin se le invierte dinero para condicionarlo como teatro , mientras en las colonias populares miles de familias se encuentran sin agua potable , alumbrado publico y drenaje .
sostuvo que el zcalo de la ciudad , es lugar especial en el mundo , por que all se renen personas de diversas clases sociales ; es un centro de reunin de la memoria colectiva .
claudia turren ; dijo que el comit de vigilancia ciudadana del zcalo de la ciudad de oaxaca determin concretar sus esfuerzos para generar un proyecto de restauracin de los rboles ; el aspecto de la piedra que utilizaran en los trabajos de remodelacin , el nivel del piso ser responsabilidad de otro grupo de ciudadanos vigilar .
donde est el pinochochetazo ?
estos dos arquitectos dijeron en otra entrevista que los trabajos segn su experiencia si estarian terminados para el 18 de julio ; y por la informacion que tenemos al no conseguir el trabajo completo de remodelacion , aceptaron ser los asesores del instituto del patrimonio cultural .
 como se atreven a decir que es tarea de otros ciudadanos vigilar los niveles , el tipo de piedra que se esta utilizando en el piso del zocalo y al mismo tiempo hacer los cuestionamientos antes citados ?
 si son unicamente los rboles laureles del z?calo el tema de de este comit de vigilancia ciudadana !
 que les importa a los miembros de este comit lo que el gobierno haga o no con las dems obras ?
que les importa que la gente tenga o no agua potable , alumbrado publico y drenaje ?
que les importa la cantidad de dinero que gasten ?
? qu , el partido politico de este comit de vigilancia ciudadana , - convergencia - tiene una moral en el uso de los recursos publicos ?
? es que este comit de vigilancia ciudadana , realmente lo que vigila son ciudadanos ?
a que ciudadanos vigila este comit ?
para que ?

Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in
place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .

Subject: entex transistion
the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
" account " team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .
julie - please add thu to the confirmations distributions list

rough draft done and my plan is to revise and edit today and tomorrow .
however , i spoke with dan lyons yesterday regarding some issues with the
supply contracts that concerned me and he agrees that we need to look into
them further . in addition , bob hall , daren and i thought we might could use a
brief tutorial on the structure of the transaction generally , the parties
involved and their correct legal names and their relationship to enron . dan
lyons has volunteered to give us that tutorial but will not be available
until early next week when he and i will meet to discuss the supply contract
issues as well . call me if you have any questions - -

Subject: california energy crisis
california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron ' s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :
? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .
? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .
? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .
enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .
increasing supply
california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .

Hello,
Since you are an owner of at least one Google Groups group that uses the customized welcome message, pages or files, we are writing to inform you that we will no longer be supporting these features starting February 2011. We made this decision so that we can focus on improving the core functionalities of Google Groups -- mailing lists and forum discussions.  Instead of these features, we encourage you to use products that are designed specifically for file storage and page creation, such as Google Docs and Google Sites.
For example, you can easily create your pages on Google Sites and share the site (http://www.google.com/support/sites/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=174623) with the members of your group. You can also store your files on the site by attaching files to pages (http://www.google.com/support/sites/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=90563) on the site. If youre just looking for a place to upload your files so that your group members can download them, we suggest you try Google Docs. You can upload files (http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=50092) and share access with either a group (http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66343) or an individual (http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=86152), assigning either edit or download only access to the files.
you have received this mandatory email service announcement to update you about important changes to Google Groups.

subject : project hurricane / bridgeline status
here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .
between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline
pipeline systems :
summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the
name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %
enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading
on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in
the process of being drafted .
enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to
support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand
that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps
scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st
floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen
center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv
will start in early february for march production .
to do ' s :
accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it
transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next
monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .
pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my
request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .
networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the
voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a
combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been
requested .
location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .
currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall
cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall
cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .
data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and
meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin
trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump
of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .
we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the
system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know
who else will need access .
interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada
application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright
from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .
there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s
rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime
there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything
is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between
pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is
complete .
scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to
enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to
them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs
by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best
done as a part of the scada transition .
accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be
better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this
process started .
hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the
billing for this one customer .
please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have
my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached
at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy
